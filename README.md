<h1 align="center">GL_OES_standard_derivatives</h1>

### [Juju Adams](https://www.jujuadams.com/)

Simple example of GL_OES_standard_derivatives use.

As of 2023-04-27, GameMaker has introduced standard derivatives cross-platform out of the box. This repo now exists solely for use with GameMaker LTS 2022 (and earlier).

~~As of 2020-10-01, this example doesn't work on MacOS, iOS, or tvOS due to an issue with GameMaker's compiler. I hope it is solved soon.~~
